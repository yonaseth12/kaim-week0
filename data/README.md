# Data Folder

This folder contains all datasets used in the project.

## Structure
- `raw/`: Contains original, unprocessed CSV files.
- `processed/`: Contains cleaned and processed datasets after pre-processing.

## Notes
- Do not modify files in the `raw/` folder directly.
- Use scripts from the `src/` folder to clean and process data, saving outputs in `processed/`.
